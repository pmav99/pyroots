def nearly_equal(a, b, epsilon):
    """
    Return `True` if the "difference" between `a` and `b` is smaller than `epsilon`, `False` otherwise.

    This function tries to solve the problem of float comparison in a way that handles all cases
    (i.e. comparing floats with `inf`, `nan` etc).

    Do take note that when the difference between `a` and `b` is "equal" to `epsilon` then the
    results may not be what you expect them to be...  For example::

        a = 1
        b = a + 1e-7
        epsilon = 1e-7
        assert nearly_equal(a, b, epsilon)          # will raise an exception!

    In order to understand why this happens, we have to print lots of decimal digits::

        f = "{:.30f}".format
        print(f(a))                 # 1.000000000000000000000000000000
        print(f(b))                 # 1.000000100000000058386717682879
        print(f(epsilon))           # 0.000000099999999999999995474811

    As we can see, the float that represents the Real number "1e-7" is actually smaller than "1e-7".
    Similarly, the float that represents the Real number "1 + 1e-7" is actually greater than
    "1 + 1e-7".  So, when you try to compare "1" with "1 + 1e-7" using an "epsilon" value of
    "1e-7" the function will return `False` even though you would expect it to return `True`.

    Interestingly, if you reverse the sign of `a` this no longer happens::

        a = -1
        b = a + 1e-7
        epsilon = 1e-7
        assert nearly_equal(a, b, epsilon)          # No exceptions will be raised!

    Another thing that should be noted is that you shouldn't set epsilon to values lower than
    `sys.float_info.epsilon` (it's a value close to 2e-16).  If you do, you may run into things like
    these::

        import sys
        epsilon = sys.float_info.epsilon / 10    #
        a = 2
        b = 2 + 1e-16
        assert nearly_equal(a, b, epsilon)          # Will not raise an exception!!!

    """
    if a == b:
        return True                         # shortcut. Handles infinities etc
    diff = abs(a - b)
    max_ab = max(abs(a), abs(b), 1)
    if max_ab >= diff or max_ab > 1:
        return diff <= epsilon              # absolute error
    else:
        return diff < epsilon * max_ab      # relative  error
